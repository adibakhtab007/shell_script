## 📌 Overview

This is a robust shell script designed to perform **daily database-dump of PostgreSQL databases** on a Linux server while **excluding specific databases**.

It uses `pg_dump` with `gzip` compression and logs each backup process in detail.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🔁 Daily PostgreSQL database backups
- 📤 GZIP compression of `.sql` dump files
- ❌ Exclusion list for skipping specific databases
- 📆 Configurable retention policy (deletes backups older than N days)
- 📋 Logs all actions to a backup log
- 👨‍💻 Runs under the `postgres` user using `sudo -u`

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Update the script variables to suit your environment:

```
RETENTION_DAYS=6                                        # Number of days to keep old backups
PG_USER="postgres"                                      # PostgreSQL user
BACKUP_DIR="/path/DB_Postgres/Postgres-DB-Dump"         # Where to store backups
EXCLUDE_DATABASES=("postgres" "test_adib_sys_2" ...)     # Databases to skip
```
Ensure PostgreSQL binaries (psql, pg_dump) are in your PATH, or set full paths in PSQL_PATH and PG_DUMP_PATH.

## 🛠️ Usage
📂 Step 1: Make script executable
```chmod +x PGSQL-DB-DUMP_with-EXCLUDE_DB.sh```
▶️ Step 2: Run manually
```sudo ./PGSQL-DB-DUMP_with-EXCLUDE_DB.sh```
🕑 Step 3: Automate via Cron (e.g., 2 AM daily)
```0 2 * * * /path/to/PGSQL-DB-DUMP_with-EXCLUDE_DB.sh >> /var/log/pgsql_backup_cron.log 2>&1```

---

## 📁 Output
- Dump files saved in: $BACKUP_DIR
- Filename format: database_YYYY-MM-DD.sql.gz
- Logs saved in: $BACKUP_DIR/backup_log.txt

---

## ❌ Example Excluded Databases
```
EXCLUDE_DATABASES=("postgres" "test_adib_sys_2" "template1")
These databases will be skipped during the backup process.
```
