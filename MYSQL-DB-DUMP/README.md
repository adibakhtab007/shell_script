# MySQL Auto Dump Script

This is a Bash script designed to automatically dump all MySQL databases **one by one** while excluding specified databases. It compresses each dump and retains logs, with automatic cleanup of backups older than 6 days.

## 🛠️ Features

- Dumps all MySQL databases **individually**
- Excludes default/system databases and user-defined ones
- Compresses each SQL dump using `gzip`
- Maintains a log of dump operations
- Deletes old dump files older than 6 days

## 🚀 Usage

### Prerequisites

- MySQL server access with credentials
- `mysqldump` and `mysql` installed
- Bash shell

### Edit Credentials

Update the following variables in the script:

```bash
MYSQL_USER="your_username"
MYSQL_PASS="your_password"
BACKUP_DIR="/desired/backup/path"
```
Exclude Databases
Customize the grep -Ev pattern in the script to skip specific databases.

```bash
grep -Ev "Database|information_schema|performance_schema|mysql|sys|db1|db2"
```

Run the Script

```bash
bash mysql_dump.sh
```

Add to a cron job for automation:

```bash
0 2 * * * /path/to/mysql_dump.sh
```

## 📁 Output
